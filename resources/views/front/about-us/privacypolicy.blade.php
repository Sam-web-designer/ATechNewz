                    <h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2><p>Like most website operators, ATechNewz collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ATechNewz's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ATechNewz's visitors use its website. From time to time, ATechNewz may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                    <p>ATechNewz also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://ATechNewz.com blog posts. ATechNewz only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p><h2 id="PII">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Certain visitors to ATechNewz's websites choose to interact with ATechNewz in ways that require ATechNewz to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ATechNewz gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at http://ATechNewz.com to provide a username and email address.</p><h2 id="ExternalLinks">3. Links To External Sites</h2><p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms of service of every site you visit.</p>
                    <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p><h2 id="PIIProtection">4. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>ATechNewz discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ATechNewz's behalf or to provide services available at ATechNewz's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ATechNewz's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ATechNewz will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ATechNewz discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when ATechNewz believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ATechNewz, third parties or the public at large.</p>
                    <p>If you are a registered user of http://ATechNewz.com and have supplied your email address, ATechNewz may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with ATechNewz and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ATechNewz takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
